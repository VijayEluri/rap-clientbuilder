== Experimental client library builder for RWT ==

Summary:
  The JsCompressor is used for creating the client library for RAP [1].  It
  reads JavaScript files from the project org.eclipse.rap.rwt.q07, compresses
  and concatenates them, and writes the resulting JavaScript file back into the
  q07 project as client.js.  The list of files to be included is taken from the
  class QooxdooResourcesUtil.

Usage:
  Place this project into the same workspace as the org.eclipse.rap.rwt.q07
  project.  Use the included launch configuration JSCompressor.launch to create
  a new client.js. This launch configuration calls JsCompressor as a plain
  application, passing the root directory of the q07 project as parameter.

Requires:
  Bundle org.mozilla.javascript from Orbit (Branch v1_6_6)
  dev.eclipse.org:/cvsroot/tools/org.eclipse.orbit/org.mozilla.javascript
  You can import this project using the team project set file JSCompressor.psf.
